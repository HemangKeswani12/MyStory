There was once a shop owner who wanted to make a surprise visit to his store to see how the shopkeepers were taking care of it. He wore a disguise and entered the store and saw that everything seemed good. When he went further inside, he saw that a customer and the cashier were fighting near the counter. The fight went on for a few minutes and when the customer left, the store owner went to the cashier and told him to never fight with a customer, and treat them like god. The cashier tried explaining to the owner but the owner didn't listen and gave the cashier a long lecture. Finally, after the lecture, the owner asked the cashier, "Now tell me, what were you arguing about?", to which the cashier said that he was fighting with the customer because the customer said the the store owner must be a fool.
